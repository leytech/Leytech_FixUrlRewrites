## Fix for URL re-indexing bug in Magento 1.x

This extension provides a fix for the longstanding URL re-indexing bug in Magento 1.x.

If the core_url_rewrite table (as shown in URL Rewrite Management) is becoming very full and generating URLs with random numbers after them (e.g. www.example.com/example-123) then you've likely hit this bug. 

Affected versions: Magento CE 1.7.x - 1.9.x
